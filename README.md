### Database structure:

Database used:MySql

Three databases are there : namely , master_customer , child1 and child2.
Inside master_customer database there is one table named customer_details.
Indise child1 database there is one table named customer_address.
Inside child2 also there is one table named customer_address
The distribution of data to child1 and child2 is done in such a way that the address of those customers whose customer_id is odd gets stored in child1 and those cusotmers with even customer_id have thier address stored in child2.


Inside folder named "documents" there are two files one have the enviroment variables of postman of the project and second have the postman collection of the project.

Kinldy use those two files to run in postman.
